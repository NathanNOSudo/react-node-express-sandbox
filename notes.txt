Create a React App
This process is really straightforward.

I will be using Facebook’s create-react-app tocreate a react app named client:

#Used npm’s npx to create a react app and named it client.
npx create-react-app client
#cd(change directory) into the new client directory
cd client
#Started The App
npm start
#To make sure its good so far navigate to http://localhost:3000/ should see react home page 

Create an Express App

npx express-generator api
cd api
npm install
npm start

#Used npm’s npx to install express-generator globally.
#Used express-generator to create an express app and named it api.
#cd into the API directory.
#Installed all dependencies.
#Started the app.
#Check at 3000 should see express welcome page
